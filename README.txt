---- E7 Roullete v.0.1.2 -----------------

To make a importable file, make sure that you have a 'Hero_List.txt' file
with your list of characters in the following format

<Character 1 here>
<Character 2 here>
etc...

!!make sure that there are no empty lines or extra lines in the text doc!!
!!adding Ray crashes the program for some reason, untill I fix it assume that if the program crashes, Ray is on one of the teams!!

Import shows how many characters were imported 

Currently importing characters does not change the display that characters were added,
but clicking remove on the character you want does remove them from the list

You also have the option of adding characters yourself, but note it is currently quite 
time consuming and there are plans to expedite it.
